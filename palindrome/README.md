## Palindromes
Discussion on ["Nif" by Cat's Eye Technologies](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/58) - my launch-point for the Palindromes experiments. In Python, which is new for me.

Original code at [Catseye's nif.py example](https://gist.github.com/catseye/7336582)

I "extended" the palindrome, by adding in a bunch of other palindrome's that could be created. Not a big theorhetical extension.
