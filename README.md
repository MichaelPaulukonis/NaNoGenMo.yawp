Notes and sketches for [National Novel Generation Month](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo) (NaNoGenMo).

I've been working with text-generation on a smaller-scale, so the larger-scale intrigued me, as well as the suggestion of cohesion. Since most of my experiments/writing is abstract and not coherent, this is a different line of thinking.

- ["The Swallows of Summer" by Cat's Eye Technologies](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/39) - uses the NPC characters in an adventure game to generate the text.

## Generative Literature
- [Writing Machines](http://www.xradiograph.com/WordSalad.WritingMachines) - page on my wiki
- [Generators](http://www.xradiograph.com/WordSalad/Generators) - another page on my wiki
- [Automatic for the People](http://www.xradiograph.com/WordSalad/AutomaticForThePeople) - guess where this is from? !!!
- [Web Sketches](http://www.xradiograph.com/PrantedMutter.Sketch) - my web sketches, some of which involve dynamic generators (most of which involve text generated previously).
 
## Palindromes
Discussion on ["Nif" by Cat's Eye Technologies](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/58) - my launch-point for the Palindromes experiments. In Python, which is new for me.
