Notes and sketches for [National Novel Generation Month](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo) (NaNoGenMo).

I've been working with text-generation on a smaller-scale, so the larger-scale intrigued me, as well as the suggestion of cohesion. Since most of my experiments/writing is abstract and not coherent, this is a different line of thinking.
