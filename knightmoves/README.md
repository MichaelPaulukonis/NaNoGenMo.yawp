Inpsired by [Grid Remix](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/33), where:

> An existing text is loaded word-by-word, then organized into a 2d grid. Using a random start position in the grid, the "cursor" is moved up, down, left, or right and that word is added. The process is repeated up to 50k words. Random commas, periods, and paragraph breaks are also added along the way.


Would it be possible to do a [Knight's Tour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour) (or [Knight Graph](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KnightGraph.html)) solution, where the algorithm can jump around the text a limited amount, but is required to visit every word one? You would end up with a novel the same size as the original (+|- punctuation).

Continuty of words is implicit with horizontal (forward, generally) movement, but continuity is pretty much broken with vertical movement. There's nothing left for contiguous-word continuity, with knight-jumping.

For text the algorithm shouldn't be so strict -- not every jump would have to be non-contiguous. It was more the idea of using each [square|word] exactly once. A trivial solution would then be to traverse the grid from upper-left to lower-right, but that should be disallowed.

Interesting note:

>In the 20th century, the Oulipo group of writers used [the Knight's tour] among many others. The most notable example is the 10 × 10 Knight's Tour which sets the order of the chapters in Georges Perec's novel Life: A User's Manual. ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour#History))


## sidewise
I'm also interested in dumping text to a grid, so that lexical clusters (words, sentence-fragments) are in the same "region" -- not a straight line or vertical axis, but maybe something like

````
.........................
.........................
....this.is..............
.......a.cluster.........
...of..some..............
.......words.............
.........................
...X.....................
..............another....
.............cluster.....
