Would it be possible to do a [Knight's Tour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour) (or [Knight Graph](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KnightGraph.html)) solution, where the algorithm can jump around the text a limited amount, but is required to visit every word one? You would end up with a novel the same size as the original (+|- punctuation).

Continuity is already broken with vertical movement, but that did strike me as well. There's nothing left for contiguous-word continuity, with knight-jumping.

For text the algorithm shouldn't be so strict -- not every jump would have to be non-contiguous. It was more the idea of using each [square|word] exactly once. A trivial solution would then be to traverse the grid from upper-left to lower-right, but that should be disallowed.

Interesting note:

_In the 20th century, the Oulipo group of writers used [the Knight's tour] among many others. The most notable example is the 10 Ã— 10 Knight's Tour which sets the order of the chapters in Georges Perec's novel Life: A User's Manual._ ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour#History))


## sidewise
I'm also interested in dumping text to a grid, so that lexical clusters (words, sentence-fragments) are in the same "region" -- not a straight line or vertical axis, but maybe something like

````
.........................
.........................
....this.is..............
.......a.cluster.........
...of..some..............
.......words.............
.........................
...X.....................
..............another....
.............cluster.....
.........................
.........................
........&^^..............

````
