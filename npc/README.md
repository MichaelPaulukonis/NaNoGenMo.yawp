## Text-Adventure games as a text-generation engine

_The Swallows_ uses NPC characters with no user intervention to explore and interact with an environment, and each other.
[Discussion on Cat's Eye's _The Swallows_](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/39) and [the project itself](https://github.com/catseye/The-Swallows/).
The engine seems pretty hard-coded to the specific storyline, with code for the gun, etc.

[Grimm.js](https://github.com/ragekit/Grimm.js) looks interesting, although it currently requires user intervention, and is barely there. It is designed to be a core-engine for multiple games, however.

I found another Javascript engine for an text-adventure game, but there were no other characters.
