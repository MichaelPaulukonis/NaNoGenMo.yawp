## Text-Adventure games as a text-generation engine

_The Swallows_ uses NPC characters with no user intervention to explore and interact with an environment, and each other.
[Discussion on Cat's Eye's _The Swallows_](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/39) and [the project itself](https://github.com/catseye/The-Swallows/).
The engine seems pretty hard-coded to the specific storyline, with code for the gun, etc.

[Grimm.js](https://github.com/ragekit/Grimm.js) looks interesting, although it currently requires user intervention, and is barely there. It is designed to be a core-engine for multiple games, however. Has multiple characters, however. May have potential for what I'm looking for....

I also looked at [Undum](https://github.com/idmillington/undum) - a javascript+html framework for building interactive fiction, but there were no NPC characters, which would make everything user-driven.

[Dedalus](https://github.com/pistacchio/Dedalus) is _an authoring system for generating Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) narrative._
