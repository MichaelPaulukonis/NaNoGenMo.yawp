# more reacting to the dead body:
# - if they *agree*, take one of the courses of action
# - if they *disagree*, well... the revolver may prove persuasive
# after agreement:
# - calling the police (do they have a landline?  it might be entertaining
#   if they share one mobile phone between the both of them)
#   - i'll have to introduce a new character... the detective.  yow.
# - trying to dispose of it... they try to drag it to... the garden?
#   i'll have to add a garden.  and a shovel.
# an unspeakable thing in the basement!  (don't they have enough excitement
#   in their lives?)
# bullets for the revolver

# Mechanics:
# they check containers while someone else is in the room?  how'd that get that way?
# 'Hello, Alice', said Bob.  'Hello, Bob', replied Alice.  NEVER GETS OLD
# they should always scream at seeing the dead body.  the scream should
#   be heard throughout the house and yard.
# ...they check that the brandy is still in the liquor cabinet.  is this
#   really necessary?
# certain things can't be taken, but can be dragged (like the body)
# path-finder between any two rooms -- not too difficult, even if it
#   would be nicer in Prolog.
# "it was so nice" -- actually *have* memories of locations, and feelings
#   (good/bad, 0 to 10 or something) about memories
# anxiety memory = the one they're most recently panicked about
# memory of whether the revolver was loaded last time they saw it
# calling their bluff
# making a run for it when at gunpoint (or trying to distract them,
#   slap the gun away, scramble for it, etc)
# revolver might jam when they try to shoot it (maybe it should be a
#   pistol instead, as those can jam more easily)
# dear me, someone might actually get shot.  then what?  another dead body?
# the event-accumulation framework could use rewriting at some point.

# Diction:
# eliminate identical duplicate sentences
# Bob is in the dining room & "Bob made his way to the dining room" ->
#  "Bob wandered around for a bit, then came back to the dining room"
# a better solution for "Bob was in the kitchen" at the start of a paragraph;
#   this might include significant memories Bob acquired in the last
#   paragraph -- such as finding a revolver in the bed
# paragraphs should not always be the same number of events.  variety!
# the Editor should take all the events in the chapter, and decide where
#   paragraph breaks should go.  this is difficult, because syncing up
#   Bob's and Alice's events.  timestamps?
# at least, the Editor should record "rich events", which include information
#   about the main (acting) character, and where the audience last saw them
# use indef art when they have no memory of an item that they see
# dramatic irony would be really nice, but hard to pull off.  Well, a certain
#  amount happens naturally now, with character pov.  but more could be done
# "Chapter 3.  _In which Bob hides the stolen jewels in the mailbox, etc_" --
#  i.e. chapter summaries -- that's a little too fancy to hope for, but with
#  a sufficiently smart Editor it could be done
