## novelizification and novelizifiers
That is to say, the act of making something into a novel, and things that make something into a novel.

[To wit.](https://github.com/elib/NovelHarvesterBot/blob/master/make_novel.rb)

Which a) is written in ruby, which I don't speak and b) has bits specific for the project, but c) is pretty much conceptually what I'm interested in.

Extension: `novelizify` takes the following parameters:

* senctences - an array of strings. presumed to be sentences.
* chapterCount - how many chapters to divide this into

divide arrays into chapterCount-blobs, with some sort of variance (for long and short chapters).

divide each chapter into paragraphs.
How many?
Based on word-count? something else?

Title of chapters? in original, taken from first sentence of chapter.
Title of novel? in original, taken from first sentence of book.

The original is specifically formatting for PDF.
Should the output be that, or some sort of JSON, with some other bridge formatting for PDF or Web or markdown or whathaveyou?


Given a large-enough set of words/sentences, this provides a framing device such to say "yep, lookee here, this is one of them novel-things."


## Plot
What if chunked into chapters, and the titles were generated so that some sort of sequence appeared to be present? IE, titles have to relate to one another. Sequentially.

LONG "EPIC" [sic] POMES

See the [jseakle's output (pt3)](http://techhouse.org/~jake/poetry/poems_3.html) from [this discussion](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/61)

Remind me of atomically tinier Gertrude Stein's [Tender Buttons.](http://www.bartleby.com/140/1.html)
